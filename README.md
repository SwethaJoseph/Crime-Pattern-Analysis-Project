# Crime-Pattern-Analysis-Project
## Overview
This project involves the analysis and visualization of open-source police data from two areas, Leicestershire Street and Northumbria Street, for the month of March 2021. The analysis utilizes Apache Spark SQL for data cleansing, configuration, and pre-processing. Insights are visualized using various graphs and charts to depict crime patterns and their impacts on public safety.

## Key Technologies
* Apache Spark SQL: Used for data processing and querying.
* Python (PySpark, matplotlib, pandas): For data manipulation and visualization.
* Jupyter Notebook: The environment for running and documenting the analysis.
  
## Datasets
* Leicestershire Street Data: Contains crime records for March 2021.
* Northumbria Street Data: Contains crime records for March 2021.
Both datasets are sourced from data.police.uk.

## Analysis Steps
* Environment Setup: Installation and configuration of Jupyter Notebook and necessary Python libraries.
* Data Cleaning and Transformation: Removing or rectifying incorrect, inaccurate, or missing data, and transforming data into suitable formats.
* Exploratory Data Analysis: Using SQL queries and Python functions to gain insights into crime patterns.
* Visualization: Creating bar charts, pie charts, and maps to pictorially represent the data.

## Key Crime Insights
* Crime Types: Leicestershire sees more "Violence and sexual offences", Northumbria more "Anti-social behaviour".
* Geographic Influence: Crime rates and types vary significantly by location.
* Investigation Outcomes: Many cases in Leicestershire are unresolved; Northumbria often has no suspect identified.
* Population Density: Northumbria has higher "Anti-social behaviour" rates despite lower population density.
* Data Gaps: Missing data affects the completeness of the analysis.
